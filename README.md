# RaagRecog

RaagRecog is an audio classification project that aims to classify audio recordings of Indian classical recordings according to which "raag" they are in. The raag is a musical framework central to Indian classical music, and it is valuable to be able to distinguish pieces by which raag they are being performed in. The main model is dependent on LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies which are crucial in the structure of raags.
