#+TITLE: Raag Recog Spec

* Goal:
+ Create a machine learning classifier that does the following:
  - Given a fixed length audio sample from a piece of Hindustani classical music, classify it as one of the following four Raags:
    - Yaman
    - Darbari Kanada
    - Marwa
    - Kalavati

* Data Collection:
- For now, download large and varied audio recordings of these four raags from youtube.

* Architecture
Current pipeline idea:

Audio Form -> Pitch Tokens -> 64-vector embedding -> LSTM -> Global Pooling -> Dense Layer -> Softmax (4 units, 4 raags)

** Audio Form -> Pitch Tokens
- Librosa Fundamental frequency (F0) estimation using probabilistic YIN (pYIN). (librosa.pyin)
- Librosa Hz to Midi
- (Potential relative pitch preprocessing by subtracting median pitch from everything?)

** 64-vector embedding
- Matrix embedding to convert midi to vectors
- Mask zeroes to allow for variable length input

** LSTM
- Use built in LSTM module from a popular library

** Global Pooling
- Use global meaning pooling to reduce LSTM output down to a vector

** Dense Layer
- Use built in Dense Layer module

** Output layer
- 4 neurons
- Softmax at the end.
